		<item name="Q2"> How many Knights can you place on a chessboard without any of the Knights attacking one another? 

The <b>knight</b> is a <u>piece</u> in the game of chess, representing a <u>knight</u> (armored cavalry). It is normally represented by a <u>horse's</u> head and neck. It moves to a square that is two squares away horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally. The complete move therefore looks like the letter L. Unlike all other standard chess pieces, the knight can "jump over" all other pieces (of either color) to its destination square. It captures an enemy piece by replacing it on its square.<br /></item>
